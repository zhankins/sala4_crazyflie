- ROS Workspace is completely set up, including Gazebo Harmonic and Crazyswarm ROS libraries.
- Successfully ran simulation in RViz and Gazebo, for simple wall mapping
- Attempted to run ROS with the live drone, but encountered an issue where the drone's roll appears to drift heavily
  - Observing using the `cfclient` plotter, it looks like the roll increases at a steady rate and then resets after a certain amount of seconds, or after a certain increment of 9 degrees.
  - From [this github issue](https://github.com/orgs/bitcraze/discussions/1160), it appears that this could be an issue with the flow deck's mounting
    - Testing the crazyflie with the flow deck and turning it off and on to recalibrate produced the same ramping Pose in the plotter each time
    - Testing the crazyflie withOUT the flow deck, and turning it off and on again to recalibrate produced the same ramping pose each time, but a different ramping pose from the plot with the flow deck. 
  - This indicates to me that there could be some conflicting pose estimation between the decks, which is evidenced by [this article](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/functional-areas/sensor-to-control/state_estimators/) which leads us to believe that we need to change to the Kalman estimator in code
  - Another issue was that there was a bad array access within the example code, which didnt seem to be fixed after changing the code. Need to investigate that further

Questions to ask Dr. Culbertson:
- whether or not ros can support realtime - building digital twin (strict timing constraints), and if that timing is simulated
- understanding abstraction of gazebo models and how the models interpret commands sent to the actual robot/drone (does it use the firmware on the drone itself?)
Found PID values in firmware:
- https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/blob/master/src/platform/interface/platform_defaults_cf21bl.h
as well as assorted gazebo models and worlds here
- https://github.com/knmcguire/ros_gz_crazyflie
began setting up firmware compiling toolchain
- installed and set up Docker and [Toolbelt](https://github.com/bitcraze/toolbelt?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Alias created for 'tb' in bashrc
building pipeline:
- adapted from [here](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/blob/master/docs/building-and-flashing/build.md)
- inside `~/crazyflie/crazyflie-firmware` run `tb compile` to compile firmware
- run `make cf2_defconfig` to make function definitions
- run `make bindings_python` to make python firmware binding file located at `./build/cffirmware.py`
this cffirmware.py file imports the `_cffirmware.cpython[assorted version data].so` shared library.

- encountering some weird things where the drone flies around like crazy when the flow deck is attached
- the following forum post leads me to believe that there might be some conflict between it and the lighthouse
